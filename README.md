Hello! You may know me as the founder of ReBlock Projections, which allows you to unblock apps on Windows & Mac. I also like to just code stuff and make apps.

# How it started

I first learned to code when I was in school and wanting to run this app I was able to get. Only one problem: It was blocked by a UAC prompt. This was also the inspiration for [ReBlock](https://sites.google.com/view/reblock). I made simple Google searches to find out how to run the installer without administrator, and eventually I found what I was looking for. But then, I was installing many apps, all needing an administrator password to install. I then made an automation using batch scripting in Notepad. Command Prompt was unblocked, so I could just run the raw .bat file. I then slowly started to learn how to code in batchscript. I went from simple, one-line scripts to bigger scripts. Then, it went on from there. I was building entire batchscript-based apps.
